A simple example for Farnaz of how a PyIBL model might be built to play Rock, Paper, Scissors.
Note that the RPS game being played here is an unusual one, with a different payoff structure.

This example is not presesnted as a strong RPS player (itâ€™s not), but simply as an example of
one way to easily structure such a model in PyIBL.

While this can be run, it is not really presented as a piece of code to run, rather it is
simply and example of how to structure a PyIBL model, and is intended for reading, not running.
